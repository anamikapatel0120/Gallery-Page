                        the institute could participate and complete the given project over a period of 4 weeks.
                        Resources and basic roadmaps were shared, and doubts were cleared over discord. Three projects
                        were released, based on Quantum Adder, Quantum Image Processing and Quantum Simulation using
                        VQE.</p>

                        QCG conducted a discussion series for all students of IIT Roorkee, but primarily focused towards
                        the freshers batch. Lectures were conducted on Entanglement, Teleportation, famous quantum
                        algorithms like Grover's Algorithm to introduce this emerging field to everyone interested.</p>

                        QCG conducted “Dead & Alive”, the annual Qiskit Fall Fest, in collaboration with IBM Qiskit,
                        from 4th to 6th November 2022. The hackathon served to provide a platform for students to learn
                        and explore the vast and intriguing domain of quantum computing through innovative projects and
                        prompts. The hackathon was preceded by an introductory workshop on quantum computation and a
                        hands-on workshop on Qiskit. Students participated in teams and worked on projects for over a
                        day. The hackathon concluded with all teams presenting their work to the judges. Moreover, a
                        separate challenge was created for the freshers who had recently joined the institute. To learn

                        conducted a series of student seminars covering a wide range of topics in the field of Many Body

                        event kicked off with an introductory talk on quantum physics and computation, followed by
                        sessions on many body entanglement, fractional statistics, topological quantum computation and

                    <p id="parah">
                        The workshop organised by QCG in association with AWS in the last week of August'22 was a huge
                        success, receiving participation in large numbers from the IITR Junta. The workshop started with
                        notable AWS instructors teaching from the root level and introducing the basics of quantum
                        computing whilst simultaneously teaching its hands-on use cases the very same day. It was a
                        quick jump from being introduced to the quantum computing world while having the opportunity to
                        use Amazon Braket, a fully managed quantum computing service designed to help speed up
                        scientific research and software development for quantum computing. The AWS interface was also
                        simple to grasp and quite beginner friendly. Overall, this workshop proved to be a good learning
                        curve for the attendees.</p>

                        IITR Quantum Hackathon'21, organised by QCG IIT Roorkee and sponsored by IBM Quantum as a part
                        of Qiskit Fall Fest, brought students with different backgrounds together from 16th-19th October
                        2021 to team up and build quantum computing projects using Qiskit. Brian Ingmanson from IBM
                        Quantum conducted a workshop for the participants, giving an overview of quantum computing and
                        IBM Quantum Labs with Qiskit. QCG covered some advanced concepts in quantum computing through
                        interactive and hands-on workshops. The virtual hackathon began with participants forming teams
                        and pitching ideas on the Qiskit Fall Fest platform. All the teams were required to create
                        GitHub repositories of their projects and present their work to the judges. Read more about the
